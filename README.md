# Calculator solution
## Time taken
Hi David, please find my solution for the take home test here. I can confirm this is all my work. Time taken to complete it:
- Base implementation ~ 1.5h
- Adding test cases   ~ 0.5h

## Notes
_It might be important to mention: I read the problem a day or two before I had time to work on it, so I happened to think about a solution over that time period while I was busy with other work. Also, I finished late at night, so I left the submission until the next day so I could read it with a clear head._

_In addition, I understand the problem stated **"Write *a* function"**, but I split it into multiple functions for easier readability (I did try to keep it to a minimum without any fancy architecture). Furthermore, to handle errors and provide error messages I changed the function prototype to include an out param. I hope these changes are fine._
